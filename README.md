ChatPDF

This repository contains the source code for a web-based PDF viewer and assistant application. The application enables users to upload PDF documents, view their content, and interact with a conversational assistant to ask questions or extract information directly from the uploaded document. 
I personally don't want to pay a monthly fee for a tool that I use maybe max. 3 times a month, so I build this and want to share it.

I'm open for any suggestions.
